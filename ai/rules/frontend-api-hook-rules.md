# Frontend API Hook Rules

Rules for React Query API operations in `web/src/api`.

## Always

- Group frontend API code by domain under `web/src/api`.
- Keep shared HTTP details in `web/src/api/client.ts`, including base URL resolution, JSON headers, request helpers, and transport error mapping.
- Split every operation into a raw request function, a React Query hook, and an operation `index.ts` when the operation is consumed by UI.
- Keep request functions free of React imports.
- Use `useQuery` for cached server state such as API health and strategy metadata.
- Use `useMutation` for solve requests and other user-triggered operations.
- Keep query keys stable in a domain-level `queryKeys.ts` when hooks share a domain.
- Use `enabled` in query hooks when prerequisite API state or inputs are unavailable.
- Keep mutation cache invalidation inside mutation hooks when a mutation makes cached server state stale.
- Keep operation-specific response normalization beside the operation that needs it.
- Preserve domain-level API failures such as invalid notation or generated-table errors as typed normalized results when the API returns a stable response payload.
- Let transport errors and invalid HTTP JSON failures surface through React Query error state instead of fabricating solver metadata.
- Use explicit named exports in operation and domain barrels.

## Never

- Do not call raw request functions from React components.
- Do not expose request functions from barrels consumed by UI components.
- Do not import query keys into components.
- Do not call `fetch` directly outside `web/src/api/client.ts` unless the request is intentionally outside the app API contract.
- Do not duplicate API status parsing or solve response normalization inside React components.
- Do not create fake fallback solve metadata for transport errors.
- Do not use React Query as the canonical solver state; the Rust API and engine remain authoritative.
- Do not manually synchronize server results in components after mutations when React Query invalidation belongs in the hook.

## Layout

- Request file: `web/src/api/<domain>/<operation>/<operation>.ts`.
- Hook file: `web/src/api/<domain>/<operation>/use<Operation>.ts`.
- Operation barrel: `web/src/api/<domain>/<operation>/index.ts`.
- Domain barrel: `web/src/api/<domain>/index.ts`.
- Query keys: `web/src/api/<domain>/queryKeys.ts`.
- Domain types: `web/src/api/<domain>/types.ts` when multiple operations share API types.

## Verification

- Search changed components for raw request function, `fetch`, or query-key imports.
- Test request functions and React Query hooks with mocked successful responses and mocked API errors when API behavior changes.
- Run `npm run build` after API-client or hook changes.
- Run `npm run lint -w @rubiks-cube-solver/web` after frontend code changes.
