# Testing Rules

Testing rules for this repository.

## Always

- Add Rust unit tests next to pure functions when behavior is introduced.
- Add integration tests under the owning crate when behavior crosses module boundaries.
- Add regression tests next to changed behavior when fixing bugs.
- Test observable cube behavior: solved state, inverse moves, notation parsing, scramble inversion, validation, and search output.
- Test HTTP/API behavior through request and response contracts when `crates/api` behavior changes.
- Test web API-client and UI behavior through public component or request boundaries when frontend behavior changes.
- Test scanner training code with deterministic fixtures or fixed seeds.
- Keep algorithm tests deterministic.
- Run the narrowest test first, then the affected crate test command.
- Use Vitest APIs such as `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi.fn`, and `vi.spyOn` for `web` unit and component tests.
- Keep `web` tests in `__tests__/` folders beside the source area they cover.
- Use Testing Library for React component behavior and public accessibility queries.
- Use Playwright accessibility queries for E2E flows and shared E2E helpers for non-native controls such as Radix Select.
- Keep `web/src/api` request and hook tests in `web/src/api/__tests__`, using shared fetch and React Query helpers under `web/src/test`.
- Keep `web/src/core` tests under `web/src/core/<category>/__tests__/<name>.test.ts`.
- Keep `web` coverage thresholds at 95% or higher for statements, branches, functions, and lines when coverage is configured.

## Never

- Do not rely on random tests without a fixed seed.
- Do not assert implementation details when public cube behavior can be asserted.
- Do not leave focused-only tests such as `.only` in committed test files.
- Do not add duplicate test helpers when nearby crate, web, API, or scanner helpers already cover the setup.
- Do not add tests for future surfaces that do not exist yet.
- Do not use Jest-only APIs or `jest.mock` patterns in Vitest tests.
- Do not place `web` tests as loose sibling `*.test.ts(x)` files when a nearby `__tests__/` folder is available.
- Do not add duplicate web test helpers when `web/src/test/render.tsx` or `web/src/test/api.ts` already covers the setup.
- Do not use Playwright `selectOption()` or `locator('option')` for Radix Select controls; use helpers under `tests/e2e/select-helpers.ts`.

## Verification

- Cube engine tests: `cargo test -p cube-engine`.
- API tests: `npm run api:test` or `cargo test -p rubiks-cube-solver-api`.
- Workspace tests: `cargo test`.
- Web build/lint: `npm run build` and `npm run lint -w @rubiks-cube-solver/web`.
- Web unit tests: `npm run test -w @rubiks-cube-solver/web`.
- Web coverage: `npm run test:coverage -w @rubiks-cube-solver/web`.
- Web Storybook: `npm run storybook:build -w @rubiks-cube-solver/web`.
- End-to-end tests: `npm run test:e2e` after the API, web app, and pruning-table prerequisites are available.
- E2E split commands: `npm run test:e2e:smoke` for product/responsive/timer smoke, `npm run test:e2e:scan` for serial manual scan coverage, and `npm run test:e2e:full` for the complete non-heavy suite.
- Product gate: `npm run product:gate` for release-level or cross-boundary validation.
- AI routes: `npm run ai:check`.
